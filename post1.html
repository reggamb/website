           Lately I've been diving into the world of 3D modeling, and it's been such an exciting journey! I've started learning Blender. The interface was a bit overwhelming at first, but with some tutorials and practice, I'm starting to get the hang of it. 
           Also, I've been diving into Substance Painter for texturing my models. I've created simple objects such as plushies which has been really enjoyable so far! Here's a sneak peek of some of my first creations. I created a cute little crab plushie which hopefully will be added to another PZ mod, and a little plushie paw. I have also created some other plushies for a PZ mod: a little fishie, a crab and an octopus.
           I have enjoyed the process of learning 3D modeling so much, and I can't wait to create more stuff in the future!
